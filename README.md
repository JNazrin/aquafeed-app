# AquaFeed
Welcome to the GitHub repository for AquaFeed: Automatic Fish Feeder Mobile Application

The objective of this initiative is to create an automatic fish feeding system tailored for individuals passionate about aquariums or those who find joy in caring for fish. This project utilizes the Flutter framework along with the Dart programming language. The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect the system with the designated device for the operation.

Key Features:

1. Feeding Schedule: Users can easily schedule fish feedings through the mobile app, adjusting the device to dispense food at specific times or intervals as desired.

2. PH water level monitor: This feature uses IoT to keep an eye on the water's pH in real-time, letting owners track it conveniently through the mobile app.

3. Tips section: This feature gives users helpful information on fish care, like adjusting water pH, choosing the right fish food, and determining how often to feed based on species and size.

4. Notification: The mobile app sends a notification after the device feeds the fish and also gives an alert if the user forgets to feed them for an extended period, especially if they haven't set up a feeding schedule.
